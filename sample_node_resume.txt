Professional Summary

Backend Engineer with 5+ years of experience building Node.js and TypeScript services, primarily in SaaS and data platforms. Recently focused on integrating LLM-based features and implementing RAG workflows using pgvector and OpenAI. Strong in designing REST APIs, working with PostgreSQL, and delivering production-grade features in agile teams.

Key Skills

Languages: JavaScript, TypeScript

Backend: Node.js, Express.js, NestJS (basic)

Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB

Vector / Search: pgvector, basic Elasticsearch

AI / LLMs: OpenAI API (chat/completions, embeddings), prompt design, RAG patterns

Dev Tools: Git, GitHub, Postman, Jest

Other: Redis (caching), Docker (basic), REST API design, logging & error handling

Note: No hands-on Kubernetes experience yet; limited exposure to cloud infrastructure (mostly worked with DevOps teams for deployments).

Professional Experience
Backend Engineer – AI Features

TalentFlow Technologies Pvt. Ltd. – Bangalore, India
April 2022 – Present

Designed and implemented backend services in Node.js (v18+) + Express.js for an AI-powered candidate screening platform.

Built an ingestion pipeline to parse resumes and job descriptions (PDF/TXT → plain text) using pdf-parse and custom text cleaners.

Implemented a RAG pipeline:

Chunked resume content by sections (summary, experience, skills, education).

Generated OpenAI text-embedding-3-small embeddings.

Stored embeddings in PostgreSQL with pgvector for similarity search.

Created APIs to compute a match score between resume and job description based on:

Overlap of key skills

Mandatory requirements

Years of relevant experience

Developed a chat endpoint that:

Converts recruiter questions to embeddings

Retrieves top-k relevant resume chunks via pgvector similarity search

Sends retrieved context + question to OpenAI to generate answers

Implemented endpoints to list previous analyses per recruiter and per job ID, including match scores and timestamps.

Added structured logging and centralized error handling middleware to simplify debugging.

Wrote unit tests with Jest for core services (parsing, scoring, RAG retrieval).

Tech stack: Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, pgvector, OpenAI API, Redis, Docker (for local dev).

Software Engineer – Backend

DataBridge Analytics – Mumbai, India
July 2019 – March 2022

Developed REST APIs in Node.js + Express.js for a B2B analytics dashboard.

Designed and optimized PostgreSQL schemas for customer data, reports, and access control.

Implemented background jobs for scheduled report generation and email notifications.

Integrated Redis for caching frequently accessed analytics results and configuration data.

Worked closely with frontend team (React) to design API contracts and improve page load performance.

Implemented input validation, role-based access checks, and error-handling middleware.

Tech stack: Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, React (integration only), Git, Jest.

Projects

1. Resume Screening RAG Prototype (Personal Project)
Jan 2024 – Ongoing

Built a small prototype that takes a single resume and JD, parses them, and returns:

Match percentage

Matched skills

Missing skills

Short summary of fit

Implemented RAG-based Q&A over resume content:

Chunked resume into sections (summary, skills, each job experience).

Used OpenAI embeddings + pgvector to store and search chunks.

Built a /chat API that answers questions like:

“Does the candidate know React?”

“How many years of Node.js experience does this candidate have?”

Exposed all functionality via simple REST APIs and tested via Postman and a basic HTML/JS client.

Tech: Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, OpenAI API, PostgreSQL, pgvector, pdf-parse.

Education

B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering
Visvesvaraya Technological University, Karnataka, India
2015 – 2019

Coursework: Data Structures & Algorithms, Databases, Operating Systems, Distributed Systems

Final Year Project: “Real-time Data Pipeline for E-commerce Analytics” using Node.js and PostgreSQL

Additional Information

Comfortable working in agile teams, doing code reviews and writing technical documentation.

Prefer backend-heavy roles; familiar with React at a basic level but not a dedicated frontend engineer.

Open to learning more about cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP) and Kubernetes as needed.

You can now:

Save the JD block as sample_job_description_backend_llm.txt (or PDF).

Save the resume block as sample_resume_backend_engineer_llm_rag.txt (or PDF).

These should be very close to the assessment spec (Node.js + RAG + LLM + pgvector) so your backend’s parser, matcher, and RAG Q&A will have plenty of realistic signals to work with.
